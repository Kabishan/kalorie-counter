# Kalorie Tracker

Tier: Personal Project

Creating a calorie tracker for those willing to
limit their consumption during these strange times.

Using: Materialize CSS and Vanilla JS (Module Pattern, Local Storage, ES6 Classes, State Management and more...)

Changed the name of the project to bear the first letter of my name. Might as well have fun with this project.
